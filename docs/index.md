  The STACKIT provider is a project developed and maintained by the STACKIT community within Schwarz IT. Please note that it is not an official provider endorsed or maintained by STACKIT.
  ~> Note: The provider is built using Terraform's plugin framework, therefore we recommend using Terraform CLI v1.x which supports Protocol v6
  Authentication
  Before you can start using the client, you will need to create a STACKIT Service Account in your project and assign it the appropriate permissions (i.e. project.owner).
  After the service account has been created, you can authenticate to the client using the Key flow  (recommended) or with the static Token flow (less secure as the token is long-lived).
  Key flow
  Follow instructions in the community client https://github.com/SchwarzIT/community-stackit-go-client#key-flowYou can configure the Key flow by providing paths using environment variables or by configuring the paths in the provider block (Key flow (1) example below)
  bash
     export STACKIT_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_PATH="sa_key.json"
     export STACKIT_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH="private_key.pem"
  
  Another way is to provide the contents directly, either with environment variables or by configuring the provider directly (Key flow (2) example below)
  bash
     export STACKIT_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_="..."
     export STACKIT_PRIVATE_KEY="..."
  
  Token flow
  Set the following environment variables or configure the provider directly (example below)
  bash
     export STACKIT_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL=email
     export STACKIT_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN=token

# STACKIT Provider

The STACKIT provider is a project developed and maintained by the STACKIT community within Schwarz IT. Please note that it is not an official provider endorsed or maintained by STACKIT.

~> **Note:** The provider is built using Terraform's plugin framework, therefore we recommend using Terraform CLI v1.x which supports Protocol v6

## Authentication

Before you can start using the client, you will need to create a STACKIT Service Account in your project and assign it the appropriate permissions (i.e. `project.owner`).
After the service account has been created, you can authenticate to the client using the `Key flow`  (recommended) or with the static `Token flow` (less secure as the token is long-lived).

### Key flow

1. Follow instructions in the [community client](https://github.com/SchwarzIT/community-stackit-go-client#key-flow)

2. You can configure the Key flow by providing paths using environment variables or by configuring the paths in the provider block (`Key flow (1)` example below)

   ```bash
   export STACKIT_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_PATH="sa_key.json"
   export STACKIT_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH="private_key.pem"
   ```

3. Another way is to provide the contents directly, either with environment variables or by configuring the provider directly (`Key flow (2)` example below)

   ```bash
   export STACKIT_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_="..."
   export STACKIT_PRIVATE_KEY="..."
   ```

### Token flow

1. Set the following environment variables or configure the provider directly (example below)

   ```bash
   export STACKIT_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL=email
   export STACKIT_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN=token
   ```

&nbsp;

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Authentication examples:

# Token flow
provider "stackit" {
  service_account_email = var.service_account_email
  service_account_token = var.service_account_token
}

# Key flow (1)
provider "stackit" {
  service_account_key_path = var.service_account_key_path
  private_key_path         = var.private_key_path
}

# Key flow (2)
provider "stackit" {
  service_account_key = var.service_account_key
  private_key         = var.private_key
}
```
